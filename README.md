## Introduction

I was presented with 10 years of sales data that I had to clean and concatenate and then analyse the data and vizualise the data in a dashboard.

## Technologies used

In order to vizualise the data, the following technologies were used:
Python
Visual Studio Code
Github
dash
datetime as dt
Input, Output, State
plotly
pandas
numpy
zipfile

## Wireframes and user stories

User Storiees:
drop downs: As a user I want to be able to select from a range of criteria so that I can see the exact data I require

As a user I want to be able to vizualise the data in a easily digestible manner so that I can understand the data

As a user I want to be able to click on a button that will display the data I have requested.

## Development process and data cleaning and transformation

1st I wrote an outline of what it was that I was trying to achieve.

After cleaning the data I imported it into my app.py folder and imported it in the code. I then proceeded to import all the dependencies that I needed (listed above)

I then completed the layout section so to get all the elements that I wanted on the page and then proceeded to add the call backs and then the functions. I did this one function at a time. I then tested that the functions worked and the graphs showed when the user clicked on the button.

## Unsolved problems

Another major issue faced was arround the size of the files and the amount of data included. It was preventing me from uploading to Github. So the data had to be massively compressed and reduced to work around this.

One of the graph also needs looking into as it is not working exactly as it should
